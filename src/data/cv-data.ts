  professionalSummary: {
    intro:
      "I've built my career by solving complex problems others couldn't tackle and delivering solutions that unlock new capabilities for teams and organizations. My journey began as a Full Stack Developer, where I was promoted to Team Lead after just 6 months—developing end-to-end solutions including a quoter module for Mexico's public property registry system using ExtJS, C#/.NET, and Oracle/MSSQL.",
    careerProgression:
      "My specialization in frontend development began with mastering AngularJS and early Angular 2, which led to a role with a US clinical trials software company. There, I built sophisticated questionnaire applications that streamlined data collection for medical research. Driven to excel, I immersed myself in advanced technologies, design patterns, and best practices through extensive reading and hands-on experimentation. This dedication to continuous learning caught the attention of Semantic AI, a US data intelligence platform, where I was hired as a Senior Software Engineer.",
    currentRole:
      "At Semantic AI, I've reached my full potential as a senior developer, tackling high-stakes challenges from UI development to leading a plugin framework development team. My contributions have directly saved important customer contracts through rapid problem-solving and proof-of-concept development. While primarily focused on frontend technologies (Angular, React, Vanilla JavaScript), I've expanded my impact across the full stack—developing Java Spring backends, creating CLI tools, managing Docker deployments, and leading documentation efforts. Working alongside exceptionally talented engineers has accelerated my growth, and I've had the privilege of mentoring brilliant developers as well. Recognition of my contributions culminated in receiving the Employee of the Year award, validating my ability to deliver exceptional results and drive meaningful impact on complex software projects.",
